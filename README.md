# Binary-B-trees
The "Binarne B-drzewa" project implements a binary search tree (BST) in C++. It includes functions for inserting, searching, deleting, and displaying nodes. Each node contains an integer key and pointers to its children. The project demonstrates efficient data organization and manipulation using the BST structure.
